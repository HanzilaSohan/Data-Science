Lyrics-Based Music Recommendation System (Streamlit App)

This project is a machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit, designed to recommend songs based on lyrical similarity. It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, core NLP techniques in ML, to identify and suggest songs with similar lyrical content from a dataset of 10,000 Spotify tracks.

🔍 Features:

Input a song title and get top 5(up to any number) lyrically similar recommendations.

Built with NLP and machine learning for accurate similarity detection.

Lightweight and runs in your local browser with Streamlit.

🧠 Machine Learning Techniques:

1. Text preprocessing with NLTK (lowercasing, stemming)

2. TF-IDF vectorization

3. Cosine similarity for vector comparison

🛠️ Built With:

Python
Scikit-learn
NLTK
Streamlit

🚀 Run the App:
